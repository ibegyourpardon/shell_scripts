""" Merge multiple `.bash_history` files and deduplicate their content.

Produces a consolidated output on STDOUT with all entries sorted by timestamps.

During the deduplication process, historized command lines are normalized by
stripping their leading and trailing blank charaters.

Are considered duplicate entries those sharing the exact same timestamp and
normalized command line.

Requires the `boltons` python module, installable via `pip`:

  $ pip install boltons

Usage example:

  $ python bash-history-merge.py "~/.bash_history" ".histcopy" > .merged_hist
